#17195	Education 2019.pdf	CPC INTERVENTION SAMPLE INCLUDED IN ANALYSIS Children were included in the intervention cohorts if they attended one of the PFS- CPC sites that was fully implementing the CPC program during their preschool year,5 were enrolled in either a full- or half- day pre-K classroom, were not identified as having a severe disability, were income eligible (i.e., eligible to receive free or reduced-price lunch), and were at least 4 years old in September of their preschool year. Additionally, a child needed to have attended a CPC pre-K classroom for at least 66% of the days (not consecutively) in a given school year—a percentage considered a sufficient amount or dose of the intervention to affect child outcomes. The project is based on the hypothesis that high-quality early childhood education will prevent or reduce a future need for special education services for children considered at-risk for developing delays or mild disabilities. As such, children diagnosed with severe disabilities were excluded from the project. Across the total sample of 733 PK children, 592 or 77% met all the eligibility criteria.

Additionally, a child needed to have attended a CPC pre-K classroom for at least 66% of the days (not consecutively) in a given school year—a percentage considered a sufficient amount or “dose” of the intervention to affect child outcomes. Across the total sample of 449 PK children attending one of the 5 sites in 2014-15, 328 or 73% met all of the eligibility criteria. The 328 students in Cohort 1 had the following characteristics: Half of the children were male (51%). Two-thirds of the children (68%) were identified as Hispanic and one-third (29%) were identified as African-American. Fewer than 2% of the children were identified as Caucasian and the remaining 2% were identified as Asian or multiracial. About one-tenth (11%) of the children attending the five sites had an identified mild developmental delay or disability or an identified 504 plan that described modifications and accommodations (e.g., an extra set of textbooks, home instruction, a tape recorder or keyboard for taking notes) that they needed to perform at the same level as their peers. About one-third (35%) were enrolled in full-day with the remainder enrolled in half- day Pre-K classrooms. Eligible Population - Treatment Group The Treatment Group in this study will consist of four-year-olds1 who are attending Pre-K at any of the CPC SIB sites, in full day or half day programs, who at any point during the school year are eligible for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).

Top  1  :  Analysis Approach SAMPLE INCLUDED IN THE COHORT 1 ANALYSIS Children were included in the intervention cohort if they attended one of the five SIB- CPC sites, were enrolled in either a full- or half-day pre-K classroom, were not identified as having a severe disability, were income-eligible (i.e., eligible to receive free or reduced-price lunch), and were at least four years old in September 2014. Top  2  :  A mild disability could include developmental delay, speech and language impairment, specific learning disability, and accommodations or modifications for children with no other disability (mild or severe).4 Additionally, children were excluded from the intervention cohort if they were in a separate classroom for special education students. Top  3  :  For special education outcomes (first to fourth grades), children are identified as receiving the intervention (defined here as attendance in a CPC preschool classroom) in the year they are in preschool and then are matched to children with similar demographic characteristics but who did not attend any type of preschool in CPS. 	Top  1  :  Participating Sample of Cohort I Children Attending CPC Sites, by Exclusion Criteria 449 Children Attending CPC in grade PK One‐fifth (20%) did not attend at least 66% of days 3% had severe disability or were in a separate classroom for special education students Less than 1% were too young (i.e., under 4 years old in September 2014) A small percentage (2%) were not eligible for free‐ or reduced‐price lunch or were denied because of insufficient documentation A small percentage (2%) were removed for two or more of the above reasons 328 Children Met Eligibility Criteria The remaining 328 children became the SIB-CPC Cohort 1 (2014-15).

#17150	Wilson 2018.pdf	The service is open to all young people, not just those in receipt of benefits, including: a. 16-17-year olds, thus bringing together transitional support into further learning, alongside careers and labour market help; and b. Young people with more complex needs, not in full-time education,who typically fall outside of mainstream employment support. The MyGo service is available to all young people, aged 16-24, resident in the above areas of Greater Ipswich, including benefit claimants and non-claimants, as well as young people in work or in education. The MyGo service is available to all young people, aged 16-24, resident in the above areas of Greater Ipswich, including benefit claimants and non-claimants, as well as young people in work or in education. To direct resources and support to those most in need, a triage system is in place which allocates young people accessing the service to one of four categories,3 based on their support needs: • Universal - Young people deemed to need no additional support to find work • Low - Young people expected to take 1-3 months to move into work • Medium - Young people expected to take 3-6 months to move into work • High - Young people expected to take at least 6 months to find work. Young people accessing the service who are currently in full-time education or work are automatically classified as Universal. Other registrants are assessed using a bespoke tool (described further in Chapter 4), which informs the type of support delivered. This ensures that more intensive support is available to those most at risk of long-term unemployment and who are further away from the labour market. A key distinction is that those classified as Universal can access the ‘universal offer’ only, while participants assessed as having ‘Low’, ‘Medium’ or ‘High’ support needs are assigned a MyGo coach who delivers one-to-one support.

Top  3  :  • The wider range of targets in Phase 3 appeared to promote referrals to other services, but deficiencies in tracking systems meant that any ultimate job outcomes from this were not always identified and recorded. 	Top  1  :  The service is open to all young people, not just those in receipt of benefits, including: a. Top  2  :  A service dedicated to young people was welcomed and did appear to be effective in the engagement of non-benefit claimants, but this did not need to be a distinct MyGo centre. Top  3  :  In Phase 3, there were no outcome payments, since the service was delivered in-house, and a wider range of outcomes were incentivised for all participants, including referrals to other types of provision, as well as job and education outcomes. 	Top  1  :  It helped when participants found out about the service through people they trusted who could tell them what to expect or through partner organisations who had good prior knowledge of MyGo services. Top  2  :  This suggests that the service struggled to support earlier cohorts of participants after they had been engaged for 6 months or more. Top  3  :  Some had a designated social worker or support worker who provided intensive and holistic help with a range of issues, from managing budgets, to applying for housing and accessing crisis support. 	Top 1 : This included participants who had mental health conditions, unstable housing situations, caring responsibilities, learning disabilities or a combination of these.  Top 2 : Referral to other provision, where this best suited the individual, was also incentivised through rewarding this as one of a range of outcomes that could be achieved by MyGo participants.  Top 3 : They explained that they knew additional support was available and were confident they could access this if needed.	Top  1  :  This suggests that the service struggled to support earlier cohorts of participants after they had been engaged for 6 months or more. Top  2  :  This means that all participants who were assessed as being in the Low, Medium or High support categories (and thus were eligible for MyGo coach support) and had completed a Work and Career Plan are included.19 By the end of September 2017, 8,547 young people had registered to use the MyGo service in Phases 1 and 2, and of these 4,961 young people had a claimable ‘attachment’ to the service.

Top  3  :  Tables 7.4 and 7.5 show the values used for each benefit type and for non-claimants.	Top  1  :  The lower number of service users also means that participants assessed as Universal are able to have more regular contact and support from a MyGo coach, if required. Top  2  :  These included: • The presence of MyGo hosts, who present the ‘welcoming face’ of MyGo: being friendly, offering drinks and helping young people use the computers if needed, as well as building a rapport with regular service users; • An open plan, informal space, with music playing, space to make drinks and sit and chat, which helps to make the centre welcoming and approachable; • Shared MyGo uniforms for all staff, which presented a more welcoming approach to young people (compared to JCP); 20 • A wide range of services available from the centre, for example training, extra resources, employment opportunities and partner organisations, which helps to attract a range of service users to the centre. Top  3  :  In Phase 3, by September 2017, 804 young people had registered to use the service, with young people attached to the service.

Top  3  :  Given the small sample size, and some observed differences in characteristics between the survey participants and the full MyGo population5, the survey data cannot be taken as representative, and is used in the report primarily for illustrative purposes, alongside the qualitative findings.

Top  2  :  When participants received an accredited qualification, this resulted in them feeling more confident about their job applications and their chances of sustaining employment. Top  3  :  Table 10.1: Types of Courses Started by Survey Respondents (N=17) As Figure 10.1 shows, around a third (32%) of survey respondents highest qualification was below Level 2, one quarter reported that their highest qualification was Level 2, whilst 24% had Level 3 qualifications and 19% had qualifications at Level 4 or above.	Top  1  :  However, the cohort data in Table 8.2 shows that 3-month job outcomes were achieved at a similar rate to Phase 1 and 2, while outcomes dropped 55 This figure is higher than those for the 3, 6, 9 and 12 month cohorts because 16% of job outcomes were for clients who had been on the programme for more than 12 months. Top  2  :  This suggests that the service struggled to support earlier cohorts of participants after they had been engaged for 6 months or more. Top  3  :  Job outcome rates steadily increased over time for all cohorts, which means that MyGo got better over time at placing people in jobs.	Top  1  :  There were 578 clients who had more than one job, which is 12 per cent of all attachments and 27 per cent of all job outcomes. Top  2  :  a lot of clients don’t know that route [through the County Council] and it’s quite a shame really and they lose out on child benefits and things like that.
