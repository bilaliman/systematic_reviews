#2598	This study used a sequential explanatory equal-status mixed-method design to investigate whether Maryland’s child care tiered reimbursement system incentivized child care centers to be rated at least 3 (and receive an incentive payment) on Maryland’s 5-level Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS). The first stage of research consisted of multilevel logistic regressions to determine the association between centers’ reliance on child care subsidy payments and whether the center had a rating of 3 or higher. // The second stage of research consisted of 14 interviews with center directors to understand how they made decisions about which QRIS rating to attain and how tiered reimbursements factored into their decisions. // this study used a sequen- tial explanatory equal-status mixed-method design to answer the question, Does Maryland’s tiered reimbursement system incen- tivize child care centers to attain a rating on Maryland’s QRIS that results in a higher reimbursement rate? // The first stage of research consisted of multilevel logistic regres- sions to determine the association between child care centers’ reliance on subsidy payments and whether the center attained a rating of 3 or higher in Maryland EXCELS, which would result in a tiered incentive payment called an EXCELS payment. // in the second stage of the research, 14 child care center directors were inter- viewed. // In the first stage of the study, multilevel analyses were con- ducted to determine the association between centers’ reliance on CCSP payments and whether the center had an EXCELS rating of 3 or higher. In the second stage of the study, child care center direc- tors in five counties were interviewed to understand how they made decisions about which EXCELS rating to attain, how tiered reimbursements factored into their decisions, supports they used to improve their EXCELS rating, and challenges to improving their EXCELS rating.	family- and center-based child care programs. // approxi- mately 18,500 families and 24,600 children // 1007 centers (52%) received a CCSP payment in January 2018.	Five of the eight center directors not affiliated with large child care providers reported that the time required for EXCELS was burdensome. All three of the interviewees from lower quality centers reported that time burden was a challenge (one con- firming center and two disconfirming centers), as did two higher quality confirming center directors. One lower quality disconfirm- ing center director who was part of a national chain reported that EXCELS was burdensome and they did not receive any assistance from the corporation. // Three interviewees from confirming higher quality centers reported that accreditation was a challenge to advancing beyond a rating of 3, with two directors expressly men- tioning the challenge in paying for accreditation.

#17192	The evaluation of the SIB-CPC project is using two different designs to track the primary outcomes, a descriptive study for the kindergarten readiness and third-grade literacy outcomes and a quasi-experimental design for the special education outcomes (first to fourth grades). Specifically, for the kindergarten readiness and third-grade literacy outcomes, there will be no comparison group for evaluating the outcomes and calculating the subsequent repayment. For these two primary outcomes, the outcomes will be based on the intervention group only and payments will be calculated using outcomes relative to national standards. For the kindergarten readiness and literacy outcomes, a decision was made in the planning phase that these outcomes had normative information so that children’s performance on the measure could be used to identify whether they were performing at or above normative trends. It was decided to use this kind of standard rather than compare performance with a comparison group of children. In addition, the kindergarten outcome measure is not available for children with no preschool experience, given that the kindergarten readiness measure is collected during the spring of Pre-K in Chicago Public Schools. // For special education outcomes (first to fourth grades), children are identified as receiving the intervention (defined here as attendance in a CPC preschool classroom) in the year they are in preschool and then are matched to children with similar demographic characteristics but who did not attend any type of preschool in CPS. This “no Pre-K” comparison group will be identified when the children are in kindergarten for each of the four Cohorts. Specifically, the evaluators will create a no Pre-K comparison group for each cohort of intervention children using propensity score matching processes. 	Children were included in the intervention cohort if they attended one of the five SIB- CPC sites, were enrolled in either a full- or half-day pre-K classroom, were not identified as having a severe disability, were income-eligible (i.e., eligible to receive free or reduced-price lunch), and were at least four years old in September 2014. Additionally, a child needed to have attended a CPC pre-K classroom for at least 66% of the days (not consecutively) in a given school year—a percentage considered a sufficient amount or “dose” of the intervention to affect child outcomes. // Across the total sample of 449 PK children attending one of the 5 sites in 2014-15, 328 or 73% met all of the eligibility criteria.	NaN	Of those 325 children, 59% (58.77%) were considered to be ready for kindergarten, where “readiness” was defined as scoring at or above the 50th percentile on at least five of the following six domains: literacy, language, mathematics, cognitive development, socio emotional well-being, and physical health. One-tenth (11%) of the 325 children did not score at or above the 50th percentile for any domain, with 3% meeting the criteria for only one domain, 7% for two domains, 11% for three domains, and 9% for four domains (see Exhibits 3 and 4). Additionally, children who attended full-day CPC preschool had higher rates of kindergarten readiness (67%) compared to children who attended half-day CPC preschool (55%). // Reynolds and colleagues (2014) published data in a peer-reviewed journal showing that 80.9% of children attending full-day CPC classrooms (n = 409) and 58.7% of children attending part-day CPC classrooms (n = 573) were considered kindergarten-ready when kindergarten-readiness was defined as meeting the national norm on four of the six TS GOLDTM subdomains. Additionally, full-day participants demonstrated higher average levels of skill mastery in the subdomains of language, mathematics, socio-emotional development, and physical health (but not for literacy and cognitive development). Reynolds and colleagues (2014) report a higher proportion of children who are kindergarten ready, but use a less stringent standard for “readiness,” i.e., a threshold of four compared with five; five was the standard for the current evaluation. If we had used that standard of 4 of 6 domains, an additional 9% would meet that kindergarten readiness criteria, for a total of 68% (Exhibit 3). // Together these findings suggest a large number of children who attended a SIB-CPC for preschool were assessed by their teachers as ready for kindergarten based on the assessment tool used. Given that this is not an experimental design, we cannot make causal attributions.

In addition, the report draws on discussions from an intensive daylong workshop held in London in November 2016, in which impact bond practitioners from developing countries shared their experiences and early lessons learned. The report includes a Deal Book with detailed fact sheets for all impact bonds in developing countries, featuring both the four contracted and 24 in design phases, as of August 1, 2017.

#17284	We show, through three ECE case studies, how U.S. cities have adapted SIBs to promote social investment while simultaneously risking further financialization of the sector.  //  For each case, we conducted a document review of publicly available contract and loan agreements,1 press releases, and journalistic articles. We also conducted 11 semistructured interviews in January and February 2017,2 including five for the South Carolina SIB, three for the Chicago SIB, and three for the Utah SIB. // Interviewees were selected based on their involvement in the design, launch, and implementation of the SIB. Interview questions covered program design, intervention scope, and management. During coding of these interviews, themes that emerged inductively shaped the four conceptual foci that guide our analysis: systemic change, performance metrics, cost structure, and social equity. 	3,500 students in Salt Lake City // 2,618 new student slots	In the SIB contract, success payments are expected to reach over $25 million, about $21.4 million from the Board of Education and $4.3 million from the city. But one clause caps possible board payments at $30 million (City of Chicago, 2014a). // These ideas are not gambles with public money—and private finance generated through the SIB is much more expensive than public finance.	In the first cohort, 595 students attended preschool, 110 were deemed at-risk, but only one actually used special education in kindergarten (United Way of Salt Lake, 2015).
#17725 	IDinsight conducted a three-year randomized controlled trial, clustered at the village level, to estimate learning gains attributable to EG’s program.	NaN	NaN	Outcome 1: Learning gains By the end of Year 3, students in treatment villages gained an additional 8,940 ASER learning levels relative to students in control villages, representing 160% of the final target.2 // Results: On average, students in EG schools gained an additional 1.08 ASER levels compared to students in control schools (p < 0.01). Differences in aggregate learning gains between treatment and control schools were much greater in Year 3 (+6,045 learning levels) than in Year 2 (+1,434 levels) or in Year 1 (+1,461 levels).3 // Outcome 2: Enrollment By the end of Year 3, Educate Girls enrolled 92% of all 837 eligible out-of-school girls in treatment villages,4 representing 116% of the final target for enrollments. // Results: Educate Girls enrolled 155 girls in Year 3, or 19% of all eligible out-of-school girls identified since the start of the evaluation. Including the 613 enrollments from Years 1 and 2, Educate Girls enrolled a total of 768 out of 837 eligible out-of-school girls. // Learning Gains against the DIB Target Students in EG schools gained on average an additional 1.08 ASER learning levels compared to students in control schools (p < 0.01).14 Learning gains for students in EG schools are 28% or 0.31 standard deviations larger than gains for students in control schools, comparing favorably with primary school programs aimed at improving test scores in rural India.15 // With these large learning gains, EG exceeded the three-year DIB aggregate treatment effect target. By the end of the three-year program, students in treatment villages had gained an additional 8,940 learning levels relative to students in control villages, representing 160% of the final target of 5,592. // Including the enrollments from Year 1 and Year 2, EG enrolled 768 out-of-school girls, representing 92% of the 837 eligible20 out-of- school girls.21 EG exceeded the enrollment target of 79% by 13 percentage points, or 16%. // Students in program villages gained an additional 8,940 ASER learning levels relative to comparable students in control villages, surpassing the learning target set by the Development Impact Bond by 60%. The effects of Educate Girls’ program on learning gains were large and statistically significant over the three-year program: Students in EG schools gained on average an additional 1.08 learning levels, or 28%, compared to students in control schools. // By the end of the three-year project, Educate Girls had enrolled 768 out-of-school girls, representing 92% of all identified out-of-school school girls eligible for enrollment. Educate Girls thus exceeded the enrollment target of 79% by 16%.
#17755	The focus of the evaluation is the DIBs funding mechanism. The evaluation is interested in understanding the ‘DIB effect’, that is, the effect of using a DIB instead of a grant or other PbR mechanism. A key challenge is trying to isolate the effect of the DIB from other factors on the different stakeholders and phases, and from the PbR effect. We use a combination of process tracing and comparative analysis to achieve this. // The evidence base for this research wave is derived from the consultations and programme document review undertaken at the individual DIB level, the programme level and sector level. // There were three levels of research activity in this first research wave (RW1), at the individual DIB level, programme level and sector level. Further detail is set out below: DIB level research: This level of research relates to the four DIBs under the scope of the evaluation. • Data Analysis: Expected quantitative figures on the performance of the DIBs, including performance metrics, outcome payments and returns were collected. Actual figures will be collected over the next two waves. In order to ascertain the reliance we can place on programme data, we have assessed the quality of the monitoring and evaluation systems through our Data Quality Assessment (DQA) checklist, set out in Annex G. • Document Review: Key documents related to each DIB were reviewed to further understand the set up phase (see Annex H). • DIB Consultations: Consultations with key stakeholders to understand how the DIB mechanism is affecting the set up and development of the project, the objectives for getting involved, as well as partnership working, and lessons learned in designing the DIB that could be applied to later stages or other DIBs. // Research in comparator sites: In order to develop an understanding of how the DIB affected the set up phase, the evaluation team also undertook data collection at comparator sites.  // We then interviewed staff working on this comparator sites, to determine the extent to which the DIB effect was also present in these sites, to support our understanding of other factors which may have also contributed to these DIB effect indicators. // DFID consultations: The evaluation team held consultations with the DFID DIBs team and PbR staff members, in order to develop further understanding of the programme, and how it related to DFID priorities in this area. // Programme document review: The evaluation team reviewed key programme-level documents, such as internal reports written by DFID. // Internal learning workshops: The internal workshop brought together key stakeholders from across the three DFID DIB pilots and the Cameroon Cataract Bond. The workshop involved a discussion on the validity of these findings for the different DIBs, and additional perspectives and nuances across the range of DIBs present. Results from the learning workshop were used to refine the evaluation team’s analysis and findings, and have been incorporated in this evaluation report. // This level of research seeks to provide the wider contextualisation to our findings. • Literature Review: this involved a literature review on the impact bond and payment by result sector more broadly, and is set out in Annex M. • Document review: this involved review of reports related to other DIBs that are being designed and implemented, to ensure the evaluation is situated within sector developments. A summary is set out in Annex H. • Other consultations: The evaluation team held consultations with DIB advisors and key stakeholders of existing DIBs, and DIBs that failed to launch, to understand how the DIB mechanism is affecting the set up and development of the project, as well as partnership working, and lessons learned in designing the DIB that could be applied to later stages or other DIBs. We conducted 8 consultations in total. 	more than 300,000 primary school aged children // a minimum of 12,660 households // provide eye surgeries for up to 18,000 low- and middle- income patients // People with physical disabilities // 300,000 marginalised children // People living in extreme poverty (on less than USD 1.90 per day) // Low-income patients and middle-income patients with cataracts in urban and rural areas in Cameroon	Up to CHF 26.09 million of outcome payments will be made // Up to a maximum of USD 9.2 million of outcome payments will be made // Up to USD 4.3 million of outcome payments will be made // All stakeholders confirmed there had been additional costs - either actual, in kind or pro bono – for staff time and consultancy in designing and setting up the DIBs. These costs tend to be incurred by outcome funders and service providers. // Stakeholders identified that some of the design and set-up costs, were unique to DIBs (e.g. contracts requiring legal and financial consultancy), but that others are commonly seen in other similar programmes, particularly with a PBR or output-based contract (such as ongoing costs of performance management, project management and verification). Stakeholders expected some of the DIBs costs would reduce for future DIBs. // It is too early to draw conclusions on the efficiency of the DIBs. No savings have yet been realised, though opportunities for efficiency savings have been identified and these will be reviewed during subsequent research waves. // Outcome funder costs were estimated to be the additional time spent on setting up the DIB, compared to a typical grant (based on 2 months of 2.5 FTE compared to a typical set up of 2.5 weeks of 1 FTE) for one outcome funder. // ICRC received a grant from the Government of Netherlands for a total of CHF 1.2 million, and estimated that they spent an additional of CHF 215k. This included CHF 699k paid to KOIS for their work in developing the concept, outcome metric and due diligence work. Additionally, ICRC extimates that the pro bono work provided by the legal firms is significantly above the 50k initially budgeted for these tasks. ICRC considered that there was additional staff time and pro bono support which had not been quantified, and not included in our estimate above, including support provided by a financial expert who joined the ICRC team between November 2016 and August 2017, a legal firm and a legal expert. // An estimated CHF 670k relates to additional management and reporting requirements, which would not have been necessary should this have been a traditional grant. // The total budget for performance management is estimated to be GBP 646k, of which GBP 254k is covered by DFID, and the reminder by UBSOF. Of this, GBP 55k was spent in the set up phase. Additional costs are expected for project management and reporting, and these will be captured in the next research waves. The verification costs are expected to be USD 494k. // Stakeholders from both VE and Instiglio commented on the increased cost at the design and set-up stage of the DIB in the form of staff costs. VE estimated a total of 2160 hours spent on DIB design and structuring and Outcome Payment Agreement (OPA) negotiation and 1058 hours on investment fundraising and structuring. This staff time was provided in-kind. // External advice on contract design and setting up the DIB was provided by Instiglio, funded by outcome funders, as well as Village Enterprise. This cost USD 86,300 and USD 169,804 respectively. Legal support was provided pro-bono, and estimated to be USD 126,046 (168 hours) for both the OPA agreement negotiation and investments structuring/negotiation and special purpose vehicle (SPV) set up. Finally, there was a small fee for setting up the SPV. // Design and set up costs can be split between staff time provided in-kind/pro-bono, and contracted time. The outcome funders, the intermediary (Volta) and legal counsel (Linklaters) contributed in-kind/pro-bono time. On top of the billed hours, Volta Capital provided approximately 25% of hours pro-bono, and Linklaters, approximately 33%.14 Outcome funders’ costs were estimated by assuming 1 person from each outcome funder, spent 1 day each month of additional time working on the bond for 3 years.15 // Additionally, outcome funders paid retainer and facility fees totalling USD 36,250 to OPIC, as a part contribution to the cost of their due diligence. // Based on The Fred Hollow Foundation’s previous experience, it is estimated that the additional cost of performance management, project management and reporting is approximately 30% of Volta’s USD 175,000 fee, hence approximately USD 52,500.
