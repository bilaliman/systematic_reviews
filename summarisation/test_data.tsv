#2598	A mixed-methods study of Maryland’s monetary incentives toimprove the quality of child care centers	This study used a sequential explanatory equal-status mixed-method design to investigate whether Maryland’s child care tiered reimbursement system incentivized child care centers to be rated at least 3 (and receive an incentive payment) on Maryland’s 5-level Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS). The first stage of research consisted of multilevel logistic regressions to determine the association between centers’ reliance on child care subsidy payments and whether the center had a rating of 3 or higher. // The second stage of research consisted of 14 interviews with center directors to understand how they made decisions about which QRIS rating to attain and how tiered reimbursements factored into their decisions. // this study used a sequen- tial explanatory equal-status mixed-method design to answer the question, Does Maryland’s tiered reimbursement system incen- tivize child care centers to attain a rating on Maryland’s QRIS that results in a higher reimbursement rate? // The first stage of research consisted of multilevel logistic regres- sions to determine the association between child care centers’ reliance on subsidy payments and whether the center attained a rating of 3 or higher in Maryland EXCELS, which would result in a tiered incentive payment called an EXCELS payment. // in the second stage of the research, 14 child care center directors were inter- viewed. // In the first stage of the study, multilevel analyses were con- ducted to determine the association between centers’ reliance on CCSP payments and whether the center had an EXCELS rating of 3 or higher. In the second stage of the study, child care center direc- tors in five counties were interviewed to understand how they made decisions about which EXCELS rating to attain, how tiered reimbursements factored into their decisions, supports they used to improve their EXCELS rating, and challenges to improving their EXCELS rating.	Multilevel regression analysis of data for 1003 child care centers, and 14 interviews with child care center directors.
#17192	Evaluation of Kindergarten Readiness in Five Child-Parent Centers: Report for 2014-15	The evaluation of the SIB-CPC project is using two different designs to track the primary outcomes, a descriptive study for the kindergarten readiness and third-grade literacy outcomes and a quasi-experimental design for the special education outcomes (first to fourth grades). Specifically, for the kindergarten readiness and third-grade literacy outcomes, there will be no comparison group for evaluating the outcomes and calculating the subsequent repayment. For these two primary outcomes, the outcomes will be based on the intervention group only and payments will be calculated using outcomes relative to national standards. For the kindergarten readiness and literacy outcomes, a decision was made in the planning phase that these outcomes had normative information so that children’s performance on the measure could be used to identify whether they were performing at or above normative trends. It was decided to use this kind of standard rather than compare performance with a comparison group of children. In addition, the kindergarten outcome measure is not available for children with no preschool experience, given that the kindergarten readiness measure is collected during the spring of Pre-K in Chicago Public Schools. // For special education outcomes (first to fourth grades), children are identified as receiving the intervention (defined here as attendance in a CPC preschool classroom) in the year they are in preschool and then are matched to children with similar demographic characteristics but who did not attend any type of preschool in CPS. This “no Pre-K” comparison group will be identified when the children are in kindergarten for each of the four Cohorts. Specifically, the evaluators will create a no Pre-K comparison group for each cohort of intervention children using propensity score matching processes.

#17247	IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: Early Learnings from the Field	bringing together the findings from interviews with stakeholders and research into the impact bond space conducted by the authors over the course of a year. In addition, the report draws on discussions from an intensive daylong workshop held in London in November 2016, in which impact bond practitioners from developing countries shared their experiences and early lessons learned. The report includes a Deal Book with detailed fact sheets for all impact bonds in developing countries, featuring both the four contracted and 24 in design phases, as of August 1, 2017.	Qualitative design. Data collection: interviews with stakeholders; draws on discussions from a practitioner workshop; 'research into the impact bond space' - ambiguous, but highly unlikely this is anything other than qual due to the presentation of the paper
#17284	The razor’s edge: Social impact bonds and the financialization of early childhood services	We show, through three ECE case studies, how U.S. cities have adapted SIBs to promote social investment while simultaneously risking further financialization of the sector.  //  For each case, we conducted a document review of publicly available contract and loan agreements,1 press releases, and journalistic articles. We also conducted 11 semistructured interviews in January and February 2017,2 including five for the South Carolina SIB, three for the Chicago SIB, and three for the Utah SIB. // Interviewees were selected based on their involvement in the design, launch, and implementation of the SIB. Interview questions covered program design, intervention scope, and management. During coding of these interviews, themes that emerged inductively shaped the four conceptual foci that guide our analysis: systemic change, performance metrics, cost structure, and social equity. 	Critical case study comparison of three Early Childhood and Education SIBs, conducting relevant primary document/literature reviews and 11 semi-structured interviews.

#17755	Independent Evaluation of the UK Department for International Development’s Development Impact Bonds (DIBs) Pilot programme – Full Report	The focus of the evaluation is the DIBs funding mechanism. The evaluation is interested in understanding the ‘DIB effect’, that is, the effect of using a DIB instead of a grant or other PbR mechanism. A key challenge is trying to isolate the effect of the DIB from other factors on the different stakeholders and phases, and from the PbR effect. We use a combination of process tracing and comparative analysis to achieve this. // The evidence base for this research wave is derived from the consultations and programme document review undertaken at the individual DIB level, the programme level and sector level. // There were three levels of research activity in this first research wave (RW1), at the individual DIB level, programme level and sector level. Further detail is set out below: DIB level research: This level of research relates to the four DIBs under the scope of the evaluation. • Data Analysis: Expected quantitative figures on the performance of the DIBs, including performance metrics, outcome payments and returns were collected. Actual figures will be collected over the next two waves. In order to ascertain the reliance we can place on programme data, we have assessed the quality of the monitoring and evaluation systems through our Data Quality Assessment (DQA) checklist, set out in Annex G. • Document Review: Key documents related to each DIB were reviewed to further understand the set up phase (see Annex H). • DIB Consultations: Consultations with key stakeholders to understand how the DIB mechanism is affecting the set up and development of the project, the objectives for getting involved, as well as partnership working, and lessons learned in designing the DIB that could be applied to later stages or other DIBs. // Research in comparator sites: In order to develop an understanding of how the DIB affected the set up phase, the evaluation team also undertook data collection at comparator sites.  // We then interviewed staff working on this comparator sites, to determine the extent to which the DIB effect was also present in these sites, to support our understanding of other factors which may have also contributed to these DIB effect indicators. // DFID consultations: The evaluation team held consultations with the DFID DIBs team and PbR staff members, in order to develop further understanding of the programme, and how it related to DFID priorities in this area. // Programme document review: The evaluation team reviewed key programme-level documents, such as internal reports written by DFID. // Internal learning workshops: The internal workshop brought together key stakeholders from across the three DFID DIB pilots and the Cameroon Cataract Bond. The workshop involved a discussion on the validity of these findings for the different DIBs, and additional perspectives and nuances across the range of DIBs present. Results from the learning workshop were used to refine the evaluation team’s analysis and findings, and have been incorporated in this evaluation report. // This level of research seeks to provide the wider contextualisation to our findings. • Literature Review: this involved a literature review on the impact bond and payment by result sector more broadly, and is set out in Annex M. • Document review: this involved review of reports related to other DIBs that are being designed and implemented, to ensure the evaluation is situated within sector developments. A summary is set out in Annex H. • Other consultations: The evaluation team held consultations with DIB advisors and key stakeholders of existing DIBs, and DIBs that failed to launch, to understand how the DIB mechanism is affecting the set up and development of the project, as well as partnership working, and lessons learned in designing the DIB that could be applied to later stages or other DIBs. We conducted 8 consultations in total. 	Expected  quantitative  figures  on  the  performance  of  the  DIBs were collected, alongside a document review and consultations with key stakeholders from each of the four DIBs.
#17217	West London Zone Collecting Impact Bond	The report is based on a review of documents provided by stakeholders and consultations with 13 stakeholders between December 2018 and June 2019 involved in the SIB across all relevant organisations (commissioners, WLZ, service providers, investment fund managers and schools). // The report is based on a review of documents provided by stakeholders and consultations with key stakeholders involved in the SIB (summarised below).

#11777	Sustainable Financial Partnerships for the SDGs: The Case of Social Impact Bonds	The study take steps to alleviate this gap in the literature, by providing an empirical foundation for a cross-case analysis of four SIBs experienced across different social issue areas and geographical contexts, which can provide first insights into the importance of SIBs in relation to the achievement of SDGs targets. // The empirical study of SIBs as suitable models of partnership for SDGs was designed as exploratory research, and organized as a longitudinal, multiple-case study. // As part of this study, a literature review was conducted to identify the main features of SDGs partnerships in the literature. As a first step, a search was conducted in Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and Google Scholar (first 200 results), combining the subject keywords partnerships, finance and SDGs/Sustainable Development Goals, to capture as much of the relevant literature as possible.// For the purpose of this research, four case studies (two SIBs and two DIBs) were selected. The final sample of SIBs was selected by including the following criteria: (i) the presence in the sample of both SIBs and DIBs; (ii) the selection of only concluded SIB/DIB projects; (iii) SIB/DIB projects issued in different social issues.  	literature review, longitudinal multi-case study analysis
#10342	A fictitious commodification of local development through development impact bonds?	This is thus an institutionalist approach to the creation and implementation of DIBs within development policies. The methodology relies on a review of the literature, done by the author, about Table 1. I analyzed this literature in two stages. In the first stage, I focused on the narratives behind SIBs and DIBs, which present, as we will see, similarities, but also differences. The object of this section was to understand the ideologies, actors, debates, and critiques surrounding these initiatives. The second stage will be the focus of the following section. Emerging from my principal question and from this analytical framework, the goal was to understand, for the production criterion, the actors involved in DIBs (public/ private, international/local), the process of production (professionalization), and, for the validation criterion, the process of construction of a market, the way to value DIBs, and how to measure the outcomes. I went deeper by analyzing two specific cases, the two first experiences of effective DIBs, in India and Peru, in order to understand their functioning and dynamics at work. Thus,my goal here is not to evaluate such mechanisms but to understand their underlying ideologies, their environments, and the actors who promote them and to question the impact of such ideologies on development.

#7568	Short-run Learning Dynamics under a Test-based Accountability System Evidence from Pakistan	In this study, we use five semiannual rounds of standardized test data to characterize and explain the evolution of student learning over a period which spans three academic years (2007/08-2009/10). The tests were conducted in low-cost private schools supported by public cash subsidies under an innovative test-based accountability program in the province of Punjab, Pakistan administered by the Punjab Education Foundation (PEF), called the Foundation Assisted Schools (FAS) program. The data are repeated cross-sections at the student level and longitudinal at the school level. //  We examine four questions. The first three questions are descriptive in nature. First, we explore how student learning at the school level has evolved in program schools over QAT rounds by examining summary statistics of the mean QAT score distributions and stochastic dominance relations between pairs of successive mean QAT score distributions. Second, we estimate the share of student-level QAT score variation attributable to different levels (district, school, grade, and student) and how the shares and levels of QAT score variation have evolved over QAT rounds. Third, we estimate the conditional mean relationship at the school level between basic pre-program school characteristics and the evolution of mean QAT scores over QAT rounds, controlling for school-level heterogeneity using alternative panel regression methods. The fourth question is causal in nature. We estimate the causal effects at the school level of specific program benefit rules on student learning in program schools. The first subquestion we ask is whether high-powered stick incentives can induce learning gains in program schools. Program schools that fail to achieve the minimum pass rate in a given QAT are offered a second opportunity in the following QAT. If the program school fails to achieve the minimum pass rate in two consecutive attempts, the school is permanently disqualified. This creates a high-stakes situation for first-time failers to rapidly boost their learning performance in order to avoid program disqualification. Applying a sharp regression discontinuity (RD) design to the data, we examine whether accountability pressure induces gains in mean scores in the ultimatum QAT among marginal first-time failers. We also examine whether any gains found persist over postultimatum QAT rounds. Such persistence is at times interpreted in the literature as indicating that gaming behavior is unlikely to be an explanatory factor though it cannot be ruled out.  // Also applying a sharp RD design to the data, we examine whether bonus nonqualification induces gains in mean scores among marginal nonqualifiers in the QAT round following the distribution of the teacher bonuses. We also examine the persistence of the carrot effect over subsequent QAT rounds. Though	This paper uses data from a public-private partnership programme and a sharp regression discontinuity design to explore the implications of a multi-faceted incentive arrangement for student learning outcomes.
