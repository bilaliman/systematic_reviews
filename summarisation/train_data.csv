#10754,"The study utilizes two analytic approaches: (1) a “top-down” method involving a survey and interviews with ESCOs to estimate aggregate market activity and identify emerging trends (Satchwell et al. 2010) and (2) a “bottom-up” analysis of a large database of ~3250 projects provided by ESCOs and their customers (i.e., the LBNL/NAESCO database). // We identified 53 companies that appeared to offer performance contracting as a service and conducted interviews with senior management.

#16600,"The research processes and methods used in this study can be summarized as follows. By clarifying the key terminologies used in the paper, this study reviews the global status of implementing ESPCs to form a basis for further comparisons with the review outcomes of Taiwan. Furthermore, this study performs an analysis of case studies of ESPC projects available in Taiwan’s governmental procurement system, providing not only an outlook for understanding Taiwan’s use of ESPC’s on public building projects in terms of contract volume, contract model, payment conditions, services by ESCOs, and contract incentives but also an initiative for compiling the lessons learned. // case study // ",Authors describe the study as a set of terminology clarifications which are used as comparison examples against a literature review of Taiwanese case studies of ESPC projects.  
#1702,"The present analysis seeks to overcome these methodological challenges and accurately model treatment selection based on unobservable factors in a two-step procedure using the Heckman selection model. The Heckman selection model can yield unbiased estimates of potential outcomes, since it models the systematic differences between groups that do take treatment and those that do not. // The Heckman selection model is a two-step procedure. The first step, or selection equation, is run on the full sample of utilities using a probit model. The selection equation models which utilities are selected into the treatment subsample. The second equation, the conditional equation, is run only on the subsample that receives treatment, but also includes a variable, the inverse Mills ratio, that controls for selection into the subsample, as obtained in the first equation. This conditional equation is an ordinary least squares (OLS) model. The standard errors of both the selection and conditional equations are bootstrapped. ",This paper assess the effectiveness of demand-side management energy efficiency policies on electricity savings by adopting a form of quantitative analysis - a Heckman selection model - that can overcome issues with selection bias since it models the systematic differences between groups that do take treatment (utilities that participate in demand-side management) and those that do not.

#17752,"This report presents the findings from the quantitative evaluation of the Innovation Fund (IF) pilot // The quantitative evaluation of the IF pilot included an impact assessment and a Social Return on Investment (SROI) analysis. The impact assessment consisted of two separate analyses: one estimated the IF impact using mostly information from a survey of IF participants and a matched sample of non-participants, while the other relied exclusively on administrative data from the National Pupil Database (NPD) and Individualised Learner Record (ILR). The SROI analysis relied on impact estimates and financial information (invoicing and contractual data) supplied by DWP. The survey-based analysis explored the impact of the pilot on the likelihood of Round One participants aged 14-18 being in education, employment or training around one year after starting on the pilot. The analysis based on administrative data investigated the IF impact on the likelihood of participants from either rounds aged 14-15 experiencing three educational outcomes (first NQF level 1, 2 and 3 qualifications) and two behavioural outcomes (persistent absenteeism and exclusion from school). The analysis of administrative data estimated impacts separately for three cohorts of participants (starters in November 2012-April 2013, November 2013-April 2014 and November 2014-April 2015), and impacts were explored for up to three years after individuals started on the programme (with follow-up being longest for the earliest cohort).

#17760,"The evaluation is based on an evaluation framework that builds on a range of hypothesised DIB effects and indicators. As part of the inception phase, the evaluation team drew on the literature in order to understand hypotheses around how the DIB model might affect interventions and developed a list of DIB effects. The focus of the evaluation is the DIBs funding mechanism. The evaluation is interested in understanding the ‘DIB effect’, that is, the effect of using a DIB instead of a grant or other PbR mechanism. A key challenge is trying to isolate the effect of the DIB from other factors on the different stakeholders and phases, and from the PbR effect. We use a combination of process tracing and comparative analysis to achieve this. The evidence base for this research wave is derived from the consultations and programme document review undertaken at the individual DIB level, the programme level and sector level. // We use process tracing to assess the DIB effect (EQ1). Process tracing is a qualitative research method for assessing causal inference within small-n studies. // In the evaluation, we compared the presence of DIB effect indicators in both the DIB areas and comparison sites to assess the extent to which the ‘DIB effect’ was more prevalent in the DIBs compared to the comparison sites. We then undertook qualitative research to assess the extent to which the presence of the ‘DIB effect’ could indeed be attributed to the DIB, compared to other factors. Our process tracing approach relies on the following five steps. 1. Creation of ‘DIB effect’ indicators (process induction) 2. Examine presence of indicators in DIB areas 3. Examine presence of indicators in non-DIB areas 4. Analyse difference between DIB and non-DIB areas 5. Process verification // ","The study design includes process tracing and comparative analysis, literature review, interviews, and workshops including findings from non-DIB comparator sites."
